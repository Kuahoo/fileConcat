# README for Dog

This program was created by Kaho Tran. Help was received from TAs, slides, piazza, or canvas.

## Dog v1.0

The purpose of Dog is to mimic the basic functionalities of cat. That means it should concatenate all files and output them to stdout. Dog should not have any support for flags. If there are no files specified, Dog will just copy stdin to stdout until it reads in an EOF character which is ctrl+D.

To run this program type "./dog [file, ...]". Additionally, you can run it with "-" for it to take input from stdin.
